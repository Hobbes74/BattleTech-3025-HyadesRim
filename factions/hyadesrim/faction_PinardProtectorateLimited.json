    "Description" : "Founded in 3020, Pinard Protectorate Limited initially specialized into small arms and armor production, but an inflow of private funding from Taurian investors and quick growth in sales made it expand its portfolio to military vehicle manufacturing and BattleMech and AeroSpace fighter support. Several military contracts made with the Taurian Defense Force have been recently questioned by embezzlement charges.",
