	"Description" : "The unknown marauders that are assumed to originate from the Deep Periphery, and claimed by Laura Murray to have nearly destroyed the Tortuga Dominion years ago. Known by several different names across the Rimward Periphery, their identity and origin remain a mystery since they leave no survivors on their raids across the Periphery and their pilots use explosive devices placed inside their cockpits to avoid being captured alive if their 'Mech is disabled. They have also been seen to use SLDF grade weapons, although their 'Mech variants have never been seen before, and all of them in a well-maintained condition.",
