	"Description" : "Jinxie and the Banshees are a pirate group who formed a Periphery neo-synth band as a side gig to their piracy activities. The group regularly releases music holo-vids of their pirate incursions, with heavily dramatized footage taken during their pirate incursions. The frontwoman and singer, Jinxie, is wanted for several crimes by nearly all Successor States, which has only helped her popularity and their music sales throughout the entire Inner Sphere, with their better known hit being <i>Periphery In Dust</i>.",
