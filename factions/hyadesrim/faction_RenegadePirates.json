	"Description" : "A group of ex-slaves and Kuritan exiles from the Antallos system, close to the border between the Draconis Combine and the Outworlds Alliance.  Once forced gladiators in the arenas and foot soldiers in the battles between the remaining city states, the White Death was born in the gaols of Port Krin, when its members rebelled against their masters, with the help of renegade Kuritan MechWarriors banished to Antallos.  After killing the city's elders, instead of assuming power in Port Krin the group left the area to embark in a rampage of raids against both Kurita and Davion worlds.",
