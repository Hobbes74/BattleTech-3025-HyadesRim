	"Description" : "The Evil Eye is a criminal network that operates throughout the Rimward Periphery, paying rewards to its 'eyes' to report on any potential deals or targets of interest. The covers of the 'eyes' can be varied, from a spacedock worker wanting to increase its meagre paycheck to a local noble who wants to get himself rid of a rival who happens to have large C-Bill reserves. The Evil Eye is always watching for the easy pickings before any of the larger players notice it and claim the prize for their own.",
