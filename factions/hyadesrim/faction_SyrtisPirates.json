	"Description" : "The Bad Moon Rising is a new company privately hired by the Duke of New Syrtis, Michael Hasek-Davion, to hunt pirates in the Periphery border of the Federated Suns.  Consisting mostly of former convicts, they work as privateers preying on independent colonies and attacking any other pirate groups that cross their path, while Hasek-Davion keeps publicly accusing his brother-in-law and First Prince Hanse Davion for not responding to the frequent pirate raids into the Suns territory.",
