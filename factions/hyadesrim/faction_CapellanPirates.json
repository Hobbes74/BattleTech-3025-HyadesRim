	"Description" : "Named after an iconic triad in Earth's history, 14k has managed to evade most of the attention of the Capellan authorities by sticking to legal businesses in the Confederation, while 'gifting' regularly the Chancellor Maximillian Liao with a portion of its profits.  This has allowed them to expand their drug trafficking, slavery and racketeering activities to rimward Periphery worlds.",
