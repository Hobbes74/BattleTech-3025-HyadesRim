	"Description" : "The Isle Avengers are a former separatist group of the Isle of Skye region of the Lyran Commonwealth. After being lured into an ambush by Steiner counter-intelligence Loki agents, the insurgents were able to turn the tables against them and hijack a number of DropShips and a JumpShip to flee Lyran space. The Irregulars then eluded all efforts to stop them while jumping into Marik and then Liao space, until finally reaching the relative safety of the Rimward Periphery, where they executed all the captured crew members who refused to join their new cause.",
