    "Description" : "Alphard Trading Corporation was originally a single company headquartered in the Free Worlds League. During the 2720s ATC underwent a major expansion, forming several new subsidiaries across the Periphery. During the Succession Wars, the ATC main office ceased operations, leaving the many subsidiaries to operate independently. Two of these branches were located on the Taurian Concordat and the Marian Hegemony, but only the Perdition branch is still operating.",
