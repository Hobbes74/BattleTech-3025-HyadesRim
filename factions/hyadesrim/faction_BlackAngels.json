    "Description" : "The Black Angels were originally a mercenary company under the employ of House Liao. While on a raid against a Marik world the unit rebelled after the Liao commander ordered a suicide attack to defend the DropShips from a counter-attack. Instead, the Black Angels took control of a <i>Union</i> class DropShip and left the Capellan forces to deal by themselves from the defenders' wrath.",
