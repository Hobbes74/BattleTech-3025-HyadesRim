    "Description" : "One of the oldest and smallest Periphery states, the Illyrian Palatinate was founded on the twenty-third century by settlers from Terra's Scandinavia region who were escaping the political upheaval during the break-up of the Terran Aliiance. Its isolation kept it relatively safe until the Succession Wars, which made the ruling oligarchs to hire mercenaries to protect their holdings from pirates and raiders.",
