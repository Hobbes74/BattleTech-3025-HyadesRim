    "Name" : "the Aurigan Restoration",
    "Description" : "The Aurigan Restoration is the name given to the political opposition to Lord Espinosa and his Directorate that aspires to a return to the more decentralized government of the now defunct Coalition. With the banning and exile of House Arano and its supporters, the few nobles who privately oppose many of the Directorate\'s policies are reluctant to take a more active role because of Espinosa's iron grip on the Aurigan worlds.",
