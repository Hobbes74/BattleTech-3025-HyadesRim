    "Details" : "Luderitz III was only partly terraformed when it was deemed uneconomical to continue the project due to budget reallocations, as the New Vandenburg Uprising cancelled all Star League colony building operations in the Hyades Rim. The surviving human enclaves are now divided into city states who continue fighting over the dwindling resources of the system while fending off Deep Periphery raiders. There's also a small moon orbiting the planet that once contained an engineering base used to monitor the terraforming effort.",
