    "Details" : "A common disease in human-inhabited space, the first reports of Periphery pox appeared as mankind spread from Terra to colonize other worlds after developing faster than light travel. The plague is highly contagious and while most of its victims recover without any lasting effects, there are strains that can cause high fevers, hallucinations, boils or even death. Despite all the medical resources and research spent over centuries to fighting the disease, the virus frequently suffers mutations that make the existing vaccines ineffective.",
