    "Name" : "Reunification War",
    "Details" : "The Reunification War started in 2577, when the recently formed Star League invaded the four independent Periphery nations after they refused to join the new interstellar superstate. The war lasted for twenty years and resulted in the conquest of the Taurian Concordat, Magistracy of Canopus, Rim Worlds Republic and Outworlds Alliance by the combined forces of the SLDF and Great House militaries, and their forced incorporation into the Star League. The effects of the war and posterior Star League policies toward the conquered regions lead to negative consequences that are still felt by these nations in the thirty-first century.",
