    "Details" : "The current major pirate band operating out of the Badlands star cluster, the Horde conducts piracy raids throughout the entire Hyades Rim. Although they share territory with the Satan's Kittens, both gangs appear to have reached an understanding to coordinate their raids, although that cooperation doesn't extend to local pirate groups, who will react aggressively to protect their turf when faced against any outside competitors. The Horde is notorious for its punishment raids against those who oppose their leader, 'Duke' Elias Perdell.",
