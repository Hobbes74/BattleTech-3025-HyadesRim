    "Details" : "Jump points are locations in a star system used by JumpShips to travel amongst the stars where the gravity of the system's bodies affects minimally the calculations required to perform a faster than light jump. Usually there are standard two points located above and below the star's plane, called 'nadir' and 'zenith' that are used by the majority of JumpShip traffic. However, other jump points can exist, called 'pirate' points, depending on the current position of the system's planets and other bodies.",
