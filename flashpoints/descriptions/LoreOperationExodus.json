    "Details" : "After the end of the Amaris Civil War, General Alexandr Kerensky became dissatisfied with the machinations of the Council Lords to gain for themselves the vacant position of First Lord and rule the Star League. Unwillingly to move against the council and precipitate a major interstellar war that his exhausted forces were unsure to win, Kerensky instead ordered the Star League Defense Forces into a voluntary exodus from the Inner Sphere, in order to prevent their military assets from being used in the upcoming wars that he was sure that would arrive.\r\n\r\nOn July 8th, 2784, thousands of JumpShips and millions of military and civilian personnel, including their families, assembled at their rally points and jumped away from known space nearby the Draconis Combine. Their ultimate fate is unknown.",
