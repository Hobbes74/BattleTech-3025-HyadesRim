[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] can't be found anywhere on the DropShip and the logs report that one airlock was opened but it's impossible to know who was responsible.\"\r\n\r\nSumire intervenes. \"Both MechWarriors had a long standing known feud but it is also possible that this was just an accident. Not the first time a space rookie accidently jettisons {TGT_MW.Gender?Male:himself|Female:herself|NonBinary:theirselves} to space.\"\r\n\r\n\"{TGT_MW.Gender?Male:He|Female:She|NonBinary:They} {TGT_MW.Gender?Male:claims|Female:claims|NonBinary:claim} to have been with [[TRN_MW,{TRN_MW.Callsign}]] during the period just before [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]]\". Darius adds.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Both of those MechWarriors seem to be spending a lot of time together nowadays. Does seem that someone might be replicating national alliances onboard this company\". Yang's remark catches a few on the bridge off-guard.\r\n\r\n\"If we ignore this, we risk more of these 'incidents' taking place in the future. But taking a harsher position also has risks.
