He had to catch up on his EVA training and his lordship is currently performing airlock maintenance.\r\n\r\nCaptain Arano nods slightly. Not much to be added that he doesn't already know. After a week, we still only received replies from the [[DM.Factions[faction_Davion],Federated Suns]], [[DM.Factions[faction_Liao],Capellan Confederation]] and [[DM.Factions[faction_Marik],Free Worlds League]]. It's time we decide our next step, Anyone?\r\n\r\nHouses [[DM.Factions[faction_Kurita],Kurita]] and [[DM.Factions[faction_Steiner],Steiner]] have little interest on this region for now. That will likely change in the near [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[Lore4thSuccessionWar],future]].\" Darius continues. \r\n\r\nThe most important is that choosing one the other three houses will also give us access to any star systems under their control, and their special missions.\r\n\r\n\"While denying us the territory of the other houses that we declined their offer of work.\" Sumire concludes. \"Refusing all of them, leaves us the option of moving anti-spinwards and looking for work towards [DM.Factions[faction_MagistracyOfCanopus],Canopian]] space.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the news from the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAntiSpinwardPeriphery],Anti-Spinward Periphery]] is that we should find plenty of work there in the future. The [[DM.Factions[faction_MarianHegemony],Marian Hegemony]] has been increasing its raids on its neighbors and there should be plenty of action for us over there.\" Kamea points at the star map. \r\n\r\nSince Aurigan space is off-limits to avoid the the announce[[DM.Factions[faction_AuriganDirectorate],Directorate]]'s bounty hunters and we've overextended our stay at thethe announce[[DM.Factions[faction_TaurianConcordat],Concordat]], \r\n\r\nThe company either signs up for service with Liao, Marik and Davion or Jinxie continues with her Periphery tour.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}?",
