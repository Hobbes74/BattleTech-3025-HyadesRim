The l\u00F6yly is a Finnish term related to sauna and used by some spaceship crews to refer to water being released through leaks that float around the DropShip during zero-g. Others, like Darius, call it 'streaking mist' for more unsanitary reasons.\r\n\r\nMission Control and Navigation seem to be the areas mostly affected. We'll either need to reduce usage of the sauna while under these zero-g conditions, or we'll need to have people periodically removing the excess humidity before it starts condensing and affecting the DropShip's electrical systems.\"",
