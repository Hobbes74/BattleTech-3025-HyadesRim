Everyone thought you'd be asleep or elsewhere! Not here and waiting to use the sauna!\"\r\n\r\nBefore you can ask her what the issue is, you suddenly hear noise coming from inside the sauna and realize someone else is using it, as Kamea goes back to whatever she's fixing in the mechanical contraption.",
