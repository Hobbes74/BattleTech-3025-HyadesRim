They will assure one last transport service to any DropShips still in those systems, but afterwards it won't be possible to return to those systems until service is restored.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Murad adds, \"This is also untimely. I've been reviewing the data from the known missions involving Captain Murray to see if there might be any veracity to her claims of a LosTech treasure and I believe we have a possible target, but it lies in those systems under the travel blackout. \r\n\r\nDarius remarks, \"Lack of available JumpShips is hardly new to areas closer to the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDeepPeriphery],Deep Periphery]]. We could also check on alternative travel into those areas, and with the right connections we might be able to find some willing captains.",
