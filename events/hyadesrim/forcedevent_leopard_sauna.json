You glance at Farah and she catches your eye.\r\n\r\n\"Commander, this MechWarrior came up with the crazy idea of turning one of our storage spaces into a... sauna. We already have little room to spare in a <i>Leopard</i>, so what will be next? Mini-golf course? Canopian karaoke booth? Tanning bed?\" Farah shakes her head in frustration.\r\n\r\n\"Commander, {TGT_MW.SUBJ_C} {TGT_MW.Gender?NonBinary:pause|Default:pauses}, then {TGT_MW.Gender?NonBinary:point|Default:points} to the storage space. I know what I'm doing. It's called a 'Rasalhague Sauna' in the Draconis Combine and we just need a bypass to the steam conduit to make a small sauna there. Everyone needs a place to be private once in a while. It's too cramped inside this DropShip.\"\r\n\r\nYou look back at the small closet and wonder how a single person will even fit in there.",
