And it was time for a change of leadership after what happened with the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDeathsMask],Death's Mask]] virus and the Autocracy, no offense intended Commander. I stand ready to support her, as do other pilots and most of the support crew.\" Yang looks at you and shrugs in acceptance.\r\n\r\nYou turn to {TRT_MW.Callsign}. \"What about you, {TRT_MW.Callsign}, where do you stand on this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah Commander, I'm merely here for the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCBill],C-Bills]]. Doesn't matter who pays me, as long as we get paid, and the same happens with whomever is CO.\"  \r\n\r\n{TRT_MW.Callsign} smirks at both {TGT_MW.Callsign} and {SCN_MW.Callsign}. \"After all, we're all mercenaries, we don't get paid for any sort of politics. And if people are unsatisfied, they can always leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shut your damn mouth {TRT_MW.Callsign}! You have no principles!!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have, {TGT_MW.Callsign}? That's pretty funny considering how you're always stealing additional rations from the galley.\" The remark causes {SCN_MW.Callsign} to laugh while {TGT_MW.Callsign} glares angrily at both MechWarriors.",
