Took you a while to get it, Commander. Last night [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] walked into the sauna and caught [[TGT_SCN,{TGT_SCN.Callsign}]] and [[TGT_TRT,{TGT_TRT.Callsign}]] in the act, while a couple of weeks ago {TGT_MW.FirstName} and {TGT_SCN.FirstName} were seen spending a lot of time together. Things got heated but eventually Yang and Murad were able to defuse the situation and get everyone back to their quarters. But not before {TGT_MW.FirstName} threatened to give a hot airlock sauna to both {TGT_SCN.FirstName} and {TGT_TRT.FirstName}. Yup, I know how that ends, I have seen a spacer couple that ended their relationship that way, we need to intervene before the situation escalates.",
