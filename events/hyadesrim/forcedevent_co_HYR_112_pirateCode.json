[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] and {TGT_MW.Gender?Male:his|Female:her|NonBinary:their} followers have gain control of the <i>Hysteria</i>'s bridge. We know that Sumire was there and that [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] and [[TRT_MW,{TRT_MW.Callsign}]] are also part of the mutiny but we can't be sure about anyone else. \"\u2026Commander,they have started demanding that a pirate council is formed and to name you as the Captain.\"\r\n\r\nDarius grimaces. \"And we told both groups to stand down but they refused to do so until you arrive and make a decision about the future of the company.\"\r\n\r\nYou hear Yang's voice from just outside your cabin as you are getting dressed. \"There's been a lot of grumbling later that we could be doing more, and for some pirate life may look like an viable option, but the risk is too great.\" \r\n\r\n\"Still, those pilots might also be responsive to a financial bonus to stand down.\" You finish putting on your spacer's boots as Darius hands you a Nakajima laser pistol. \"Just for safety, {COMMANDER.FirstName}\".\r\n\r\n\"It is possible to override the bridge's controls from one of the aft auxiliary control panels. This should allow us to disable the hatches and trap them inside, and if they don't surrender we can always drop their oxygen levels until they pass out.\"\r\n\r\nYang shouts from your cabin's door \"Don't keep us waiting on this one boss, because either we take action now or we'll be close to mutiny soon.\"",
