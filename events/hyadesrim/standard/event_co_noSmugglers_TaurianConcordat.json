And we'll still have a hefty fine to pay as uncollected import tariffs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or... we know that  [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] is wanted by the local authorities. If we give \r\n{TGT_MW.Gender?Male:him|Female:her|NonBinary:their} to them and pay the fine, that should get us off the hook\".\r\n\r\n\"The crew might not like it, but it's either us or \r\n{TGT_MW.Gender?Male:him|Female:her|NonBinary:their}.
