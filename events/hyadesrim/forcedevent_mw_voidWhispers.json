During a calibration of our sensor array while leaving [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]], we accidently discovered an old transmission during the full spectrum tests. It was too faint but definitely artificial in origin and we'll be able to listen to it better, if we adjust the comms array for better gain.\"\r\n\r\n\"What possible use can we have for a possibly decades old radio signal out of nowhere?\" Darius skeptical tone continues. \"We're not here to do science, Dr. Murad.\"\r\n\r\n\"It could be a distress signal from a JumpShip that became stranded during a misjump accident. Or even from something dating back to the Star League. We should verify this. \" Murad continues. \"[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] has been helping me trying to figure out the transmission but we need go outside to manually adjust the array when the <i>Hysteria</i> is at optimal range.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Murad is right about the possibility of a stranded spaceship or lost colony but depending on the signal's distance the survivors might have already died. \" Sumire ponders. \"This could be anything.
