    "Details" : "Born into slavery on a Periphery world that hardly anyone in civilized space knows its name, you were taught how to operate and maintain the agricultural machinery used by the petty tyrant that ruled the planet as its bandit kingdom. As you grew, so did your dreams of escaping the poverty and oppression you saw around you, as your father died early of disease and your mother was executed for stealing food from the farms.

This is where you met Raju \"Mastiff\", the commander of the lance sent to your world, who became impressed by your new found skills as a MechWarrior and offered you and your new <i>Phoenix Hawk</i> a trainee slot in his unit..",
