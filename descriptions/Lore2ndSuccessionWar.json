    "Name" : "Second Succession War",
    "Details" : "The Second Succession War started in 2830, nine years after the end of the First Succession War, with the five successor states using the interwar period to rebuilt their devastated armies and economies and preparing for a renewal of hostilities. The new war lasted until 2864, and the level of destruction and technological decline became even steeper, until all the states ceased major hostilities due to shortage of resources and loss of infrastructure. Overall, the average technological level of the Inner Sphere declined to 21st century Terra, and many systems further receded or were completely lost, with hundreds of millions of military and civilian casualties.",
