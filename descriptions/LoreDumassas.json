    "Details" : "The Dumassas system was once the capital of the Badlands cluster until it was cut-off from the rest of the Concordat during the Third Succession War. Already an anomaly in a world of farmers and ranchers, the planetary capital then assumed power over the entire world, and turned itself into the major center in the region for entertainment, including all kinds of vices, most of them involving HPG scams and C-Bill forgery.",
