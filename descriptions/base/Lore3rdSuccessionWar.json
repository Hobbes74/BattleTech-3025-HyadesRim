    "Name" : "Third Succession War",
    "Details" : "After the end of the Second Succession War, the devastated armies of the Successor Lords switched to a lower intensity combat, in order to preserve strategic assets and military forces, specially BattleMechs, that couldn't be easily replaced anymore due to the destruction of factories and general technology loss. Large invasions were replaced by border raids and subversion and entire planets could be dominated by single 'Mech lances, with assets switching hands regularly rather than losing it permanently to destruction. This state of conflict has perdured for nearly two centuries until our current days.",
