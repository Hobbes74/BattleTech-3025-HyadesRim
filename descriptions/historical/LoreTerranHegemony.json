    "Name" : "Terran Hegemony",
    "Details" : "The sucessor state to the Terran Alliance after Terra's outer colonies rebelled and created their own interstellar states, the Terran Hegemony was lead by House Cameron and its armed forces became the core of the SDLF after the creation of the Star League. Consisting of more than a hundred systems centered on the cradle of Terra, the Hegemony was the most advanced interstellar state for more than 400 years, developing many of technologies that are used today. \n\nMost of the Hegemony's systems were devastated by the Amaris Coup and the subsequent campaign to liberate Terra. With the extinction of the Cameron dinasty and the departure of the SLDF during General Kerensky's Exodus, its worlds became leaderless and nearly defenseless against the power grabs of the Great Houses that lead to the First Succession War, bringing an end to the Hegemony.",
