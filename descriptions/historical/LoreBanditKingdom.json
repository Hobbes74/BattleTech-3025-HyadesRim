    "Name" : "Bandit Kingdom",
    "Details" : "As the Star League descended into the continuous warfare of the Succession Wars, a number of pirate groups and renegade military found their way into the sparsely inhabited regions of the Periphery. Once there they took control of entire systems and founded a number of bandit kingdoms based on rule through fear and violence. Most bandit kingdoms have a short-lived existence before being ripped apart by their near continuous internal and external power struggles, but a few were able to evolve to established Periphery powers, like the Oberon Confederation and the Tortuga Dominions.",
