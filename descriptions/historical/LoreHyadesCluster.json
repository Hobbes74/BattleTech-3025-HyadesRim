    "Details" : "Discovered and colonized in the 2250s by an expedition led by Samantha Calderon, the later founder of the Taurian Concordat, the Hyades Cluster is composed of hundreds of stars and thousands of asteroids and planets, making it a navigational challenge for spaceships. It contains at least eight habitable worlds, including Taurus, the capital of the Concordat, and it houses the majority of its military-industrial complex, protected by a large contingent of the Taurian Defense Force.",
