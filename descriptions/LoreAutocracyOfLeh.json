    "Details" : "The Autocracy emerged after the end of the Star League in still unclear circunstances since the order has deliberately destroyed nearly all of Leh's past records during their regular purges of forbidden knowledge. Using still functional BattleMechs they were able to subdue all the human settlements on the planet and installed a religious theocracy to cement their power, with power shared amongst a ruling council.",
