    "Name" : "Antithesis Creed",
    "Details" : "The Antithesis Creed is a jaded Periphery philosophy which coalesced in the wake of the Amaris Civil War. Followers of 'the Creed' believe that anything of distinctly Terran or Inner Sphere origin is immoral and contrary to the ideals of the 'Periphery'. The Antithesis Creed has been the foundation of many anarchist movements throughout the Periphery, including the Hyades Rim; these disaffected people see the Inner Sphere as a damning influence and wish to be rid of their presence, usually through violent means and joining forces with local criminal elements that they deem worthy of their cause.",
