    "Details" : "As the Succession Wars progressed and the technological levels declined with the destruction of BattleMech manufacturing and repair centers, the technicians capable of maintaining 'Mechs became even more valuable than pilots because of their practical knowledge and improvisation skills to repair the machines without proper logistical support.
