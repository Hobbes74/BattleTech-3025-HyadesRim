    "Details" : "One of the earliest worlds founded by Earth's initial expansion into space, Skye's original colonists originated from the Terran region of the British Isles. A heavy industrialized world and the capital of the Isle of Skye region of the Lyran Commonwealth, the world is one of the most important House Steiner possessions. Its natives are also proud of their cultural identity, which has fueled a separatist movement seeking to regain Skye's independence.",
