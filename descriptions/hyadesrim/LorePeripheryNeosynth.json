    "Details" : "One of the many musical styles that humanity has created over thousands of years, Periphery neosynth first appeared after the Reunification War, as a silent way to protest the Star League by the populations that had just been conquered by First Lord Ian Cameron and his SLDF legions. As the Succession Wars dragged on, the style saw a resurgence of new bands among the several Periphery nations, and has even gained a few followers in the Inner Sphere with its flashy wardrobes and jingle like melodies.",
