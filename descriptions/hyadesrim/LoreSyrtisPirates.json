Consisting mostly of former convicts, they work as privateers preying on independent colonies and attacking any other pirate groups that cross their path, while Hasek-Davion keeps publicly accusing his brother-in-law and First Prince Hanse Davion for not responding to the frequent pirate raids into the Suns territory.",
