    "Name" : "Fourth Succession War",
    "Details" : "Despite the end of the Third Succession War by 3025 and the cessation of general hostilities between the major Inner Sphere powers, the recent signing of cooperation treaties between Houses Davion and Steiner in the recent FedCom Accords, and the corresponding Concord of Kapteyn signed between Houses Kurita, Liao and Marik have created two opposing power blocs. Many consider to be a matter of time until general warfare erupts again in a new succession war.",
