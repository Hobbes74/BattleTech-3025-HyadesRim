    "Name" : "Flat Galaxy Theory",
    "Details" : "After the success of the Project Deimos and the subsequent expansion of mankind to the stars, a number of social movements soon appeared during the twenty-third century on Terra that questioned the colonization programme of the Terran Alliance. Proclaiming themselves as skeptics, some like the Flat Galaxy Society affirmed that the entire science behind the Kearny-Fuchida jump drive was a hoax designed by the elites to brainwash the population and keep a monopoly on interstellar travel. The group's impossible claims that the galaxy and the universe were two-dimensional in nature were seem as a practical joke later during the Star League but they became revived as part of the pseudoscience that grew out of the decline of civilization during the Succession Wars.",
