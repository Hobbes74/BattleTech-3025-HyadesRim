    "Details" : "PPC is the name of a well known cocktail drink popular across the Inner Sphere, with local variations on its contents depending on the region of the Successor State where it is served. Like its BattleMech weapon namesake, the PPC punches a powerful numbing blow to anyone who consumes the cocktail. Lyrans use schnapps in their version while sake is used in the Combine, whiskey for Davion, plus several regional variations. Responsible for more bar brawls than other drink in human history because choosing a flavor is usually seen by other patrons as a sign of a national allegiance.",
