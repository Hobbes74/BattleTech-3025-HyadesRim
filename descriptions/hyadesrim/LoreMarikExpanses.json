    "Details" : "The Marik Expanses is the name given to the Periphery worlds adjacent to the Free Worlds League on its rimward border. The term has fallen largely in disuse after the fall of the Star League due to its association with the expansionist policies of House Marik towards the Magistracy of Canopus that resulted in the loss of several Canopian worlds to the FWL.",
