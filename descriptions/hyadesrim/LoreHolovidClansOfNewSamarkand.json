    "Details": "The kick-off to the Neo-Mongol trend that later swept through the Inner Sphere in the 2900s, Clans of New Samarkand is about the rise of a group of young warriors led by their messiah leader, who end up conquering most of the Draconis Combine and later other worlds during the Reunification War and recreate Terra's Mongol Ilkhanate. While scholars and critics decry the numerous historical mistakes of the story and production, the series is still very popular with the lower castes of the Combine.",
