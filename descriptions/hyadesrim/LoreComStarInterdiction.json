    "Name" : "Communications Interdiction",
    "Details" : "A Communications Interdiction may be imposed by ComStar upon an individual, company or even an interstellar nation, if ComStar believes them to be a threat to their operations or to the stability of the Inner Sphere. When an Interdiction is declared by either ComStar's Primus or its First Circuit, the person or entity affected is totally banned from using the Hyper Pulse Generators and any other communication or transport services of the Order.\r\n\r\nThe biggest known Interdictions issued by ComStar are the Exclusion of Tharkad of 2823, caused when the Lyran Commonwealth attempted to tax ComStar, and the Exclusion of Free Worlds League in 2837, when House Marik troops razed ComStar's HPG generator in the world of Oriente. In all cases the loss of instant interstellar communications was sufficient for both nations to stand down and/or pay ComStar reparations.",
