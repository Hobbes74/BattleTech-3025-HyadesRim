    "Details" : "Once a thriving member of the Terran Hegemony known for its agricultural products and tourism attractions, Bryant suffered heavily during the Amaris Civil War and the destruction of the orbital mirrors that controlled the planet's massive storms. When it was occupied by House Liao forces during the First Succession War, all of its population had relocated to its poles because of the hostility of its natural climate and the Capellans used the world as a prison planet.",
