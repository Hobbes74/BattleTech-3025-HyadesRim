    "Details" : "Once the SLDF's Thirty-fifth Dragoon Regiment, the unit chose not to join General Kerensky's exodus and joined Taurian service, becoming the Concordat's Cuirassers. The regiment has seen prolonged action against the Federated Suns' Capellan March, with anti-Davion sentiment going rampant across the unit. The unit's battalions are usually deployed between the Davion border and the Hyades Cluster.",
