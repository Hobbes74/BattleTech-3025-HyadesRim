    "Details" : "Celano was settled at the beginning of the third millenium and remained a backward planet until a local farmer unearthed a still intact SLDF cache. Since then the system has quickly developed a niche Lostech industry, despite orbiting a B-class blue giant star that significantly increases the travel times to and from the jump points. The planet is plagued by constant storm sytems that restrict human settlement.",
