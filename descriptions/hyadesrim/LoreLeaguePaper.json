    "Details" : "The fall of the Star League and the centuries of conflict of the Succession Wars brought along something unexpected: toilet paper shortages in several hundred worlds due to the declining commerce and the destruction of JumpShips normally assigned to consumer goods distribution. One brand, Royal League Paper, became specially known because of its multi-sheet quality and its black market value price, which skyrocketed after its last remaining factory was destroyed in 2921.",
