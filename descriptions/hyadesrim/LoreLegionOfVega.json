    "Details" : "The legions of Vega are three BattleMech regiments that were created by Coordinator Takashi Kurita to contain and control all the dissidents and malcontents within the Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery by assigning them to specific units, and he even assigned his own son, Theodore, to command the Legion after a falling out between both men. Named 'The Pillagers, 'The Boozers' and 'The Looters', the three regiments have lived up to their names and even started calling the rat that appears on their insignia as Takashi.",
