    "Details" : "The Piranha principle is commonly used to justify the reasons why the major Great Houses of the Inner Sphere avoid trying to conquer the minor Periphery powers. According to it, the balance of power between the major and minor houses is maintained because the cost of a war on a smaller power by a major house would leave it vulnerable to the other major powers, who would sense the blood in the water to take advantage and attack it like a group of the carnivorous fish.",
