    "Name" : "Taurian Canopian War",
    "Details" : "A brief conflict between both Periphery states that took place in 2813-14 during the end days of the First Succession War. As a result of anti-Davion paranoia, Taurian forces invaded three border worlds, Herotitus, Detroit and Spencer, in an attempt to annex them and their resources. The following Magistrack counterattack at Spencer and Portland, plus the Taurian defeat at Herotitus and stalemate at Detroit and the heavy material losses suffered by both sides brought the conflict to a quick end.",
