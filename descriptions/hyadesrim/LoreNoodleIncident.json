    "Details" : "A minor interstellar crisis between the Outwards Alliance and the Draconis Combine, the so called 'noodle incident' started after a series of bad agricultural crops in Alliance worlds caused a drop in exports and left several Kurita worlds facing shortages of cereals. Facing increasing unrest due to the lack of noodles to feed their population, the Combine authorities decided to issue several ultimatums to their Periphery supplies, while mobilizing their 'Mech regiments to forcefully gain control of the crop-producting worlds, if necessary.",
