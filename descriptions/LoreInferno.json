    "Details": "Inferno missiles usually contain napalm or other incendiary fluids instead of the high explosive warheads used in regular SRMs. The warhead deploys its contents right before hitting its target, consisting of an adhesive gel and a high-temperature flammable chemical that will then stick to the surface and ignite. Infernos are particularly effective against infantry but they can also be used against BattleMechs.",
