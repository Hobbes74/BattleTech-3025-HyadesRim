    "Details" : "The main city of Dumassas, effectively a city-state that serves as representative for the entire system. Once a thriving travel destination, Dumassas City's vast neighborhoods were slowly abandoned as the flow of visitors decayed over the centuries after the fall of the Star League. The city is still a Periphery hub for those who seek entretainment and/or violence.",
