    "Name" : "Vel'gr Desert",
    "Details" : "A semi-mythical location comprising of a vast wasteland that once occupied most of the planet's land surface until God Mecha made the oceans recede life flourish after the Arauts eliminated all the evilness and wicked that roamed over it. Most, if not all all of the population shares this belief, with the first pilgrimages dating from before the Star League, which are escorted by the Arauts. Scientifically it's impossible for such a large planetary surface to have suffered so a change and there's no records of any attempts to human colonization of Leh before the Star League era.",
