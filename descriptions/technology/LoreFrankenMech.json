    "Name" : "FrankenMech",
    "Details" : "A FrankenMech is a BattleMech whose chassis is made out of parts of different models, usually by replacing the 'Mech limbs but in some extreme case by attaching a wholly different torso. While FrankenMechs are more prone to mechanical failures due to their improvised nature, the grim reality of the Succession Wars with reducing BattleMech numbers and limited spare parts, plus the general loss of technical knowledge, may force MechTechs and units to turn to these chimaera models.",
