    "Name" : "Dispossessed",
    "Details" : "During the Succession Wars, any MechWarrior who lost their personal BattleMech was considered to be 'dispossessed', which resulted in a loss of social status that was considered to be shameful and dishonorful. Many pilots would instead choose death in combat than risking becoming 'dispossessed', since the rarity of working BattleMech factories to replace battlefield losses meant that they would never pilot a 'Mech again, with some even disabling their ejection systems.",
