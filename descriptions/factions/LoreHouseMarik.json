    "Details" : "\"WE STAND UNITED.\" The Free Worlds League, the oldest of all Successor States, has long been ruled by House Marik. The League is an open, multicultural state, consisting of many great and small realms loosely joined together. Politically fragile and frequently riven with instability; House Marik has relied heavily on free trade and technological advancement to keep pace with its rivals. The current Captain-General of the League is Janos Marik, who secured his rule after defeating Anton, one of his brothers who challenged his rule during a brief civil war that ended in 3015.",
