    "Details" : "The Harbingers of Doom are rumored to originate from the Deep Periphery and are known to conduct deep strike raids into more populated areas. They are likely to be a stray colony group who decided to go pirate in order to survive and started raiding other colonies and trading JumpShips, which allowed them to become more ambitious in their attacks. The group is known to offer membership into its ranks to any survivors captured. Any negative replies to their offer are subsequently airlocked into the vacuum of space.",
