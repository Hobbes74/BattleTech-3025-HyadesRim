    "Details" : "A philosophical movement born out of the horrors of the Succession Wars, the New Hedons preach that the end of mankind is inevitable and that the only rational solution for the end of days is to indulge into all sorts of pleasure activities, and the most extreme the better. This ideology caused millions of people to move to the Magistracy of Canopus and independent Periphery worlds where they developed entire pleasure industries, and in some states banned due to 'immoral' and 'indecent' content.",
