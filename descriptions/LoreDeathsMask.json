    "Name" : "Death's Mask",
    "Details" : "A class V bioweapon developed by the Taurian Concordat during the Reunification War, the Death's Mask was created to cripple and demoralize any invading force. The agent was developed from the Periphery Pox using lost gene editing technologies that increased its mortality while making it almost impossible to develop any vaccine or effective treatment due to its genetic variability, similar to AIDS or the common flu of ancient Terra. Its name comes from the twisted and contorted facial expression of its victims, who suffer excruciating deaths.",
