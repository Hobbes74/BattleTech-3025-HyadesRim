    "Details" : "A mysterious Deep Periphery group that appeared in 2825 in a series of raids against border worlds of the Draconis Combine. Their name came from the advanced BattleMechs they were piloting and a recovered insignia displaying the former north american state, similar to that of the SLDF's 331st Royal BattleMech. After stealing what they wanted while defeating the Kuritan defenders, the raiders eventually left the Combine near the Davion border and were never seem again.",
