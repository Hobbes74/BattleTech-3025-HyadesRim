    "Name" : "Richard Cameron",
    "Details" : "Born 2744, died 2766.\r\n\r\nThe sixth and last First Lord of the Star League, Richard was still a minor when he ascended to the throne after the death of his father Simon. His inexperience and youth led him to become enchanted with Stephan Amaris, which manipulated him into a nearly dictatorial policy of oppression that turned the Council Lords against him and the Periphery to rebel against the Star League and his role. \r\n\r\nHe and his entire family were murdered by Stephan when he took control of the Hegemony on the coup that created the Amaris Empire, with Richard only realizing at the end that he had been betrayed by what he considered to be his best friend. With the death of Richard, House Cameron became extinct.",
