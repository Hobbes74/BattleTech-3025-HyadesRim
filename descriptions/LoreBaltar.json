    "Details" : "This former Taurian system was once abandoned due to limited resources and an almost non-existant atmosphere. It has recentely been reoccupied by deep space travellers, with a series of orbital colonies reactivated around the moon of one of the system's gas giants. There are reports of a refugee movement into arriving at Baltar, all originating from the Deep Periphery.",
