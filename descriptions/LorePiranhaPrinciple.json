    "Details" : "The Piranha principle is commonly used to justify the reasons why the major Great Houses of the Inner Sphere avoid attacking the minor Periphery powers. According to it, the balance of power between the major and minor houses is maintained because an attack on a smaller power would make the attacker vulnerable to the other major powers, who would sense the blood in the water and attack  like a group of the carnivorous fish.",
