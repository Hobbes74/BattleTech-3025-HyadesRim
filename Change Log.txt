* All LosTech 'Mechs equipped with improved communications (+1 individual iniciative) or command computers (+1 lance iniciative can only be found in the new pirate subfactions, to balance their overall appearance; this not do apply to the vanilla Cyclops CP-10-Z

1.2
* Applied the KISS principle to the added canon 'Mechs and faction variants by reverting to HBS's system of 'Mech tag/lances, which should solve issues with the game not finding 'Mechs to fill slots. This should fix the overabundance of Phoenix Hawks and make those lances less black/white, reflecting 'Mechs salvaged from other factions, but this won't apply to the new subfactions to keep their uniqueness
* Some rare 'Mechs like the Hussar, Fire Bee, Firefly, Gladiator, Chameleon, Ostwar, can now only appear in Local Government/Local Pirates lances, reflecting their canon descriptions that state that in 3025 they can only be found in the Periphery
* Corrected several 'Mech tags for better spawning (WIP)
* Corrected several 'Mech names to comply with the vanilla standard
* Replaced the generic pirate icon placeholder for the pirate subfactions leaders with portraits of the backers

* Corrected the Hermes height
* Removed MON-68, 69 and 70 of the possible random starting 'Mechs
* Deactivated the WLF-1B variant of the Wolfhound. Since it merely switches the rear lasers to the front, and since BT doesn't use that feature, this simply results in chassis duplication 

1.1
* Fixed Fire Bee chassis name
* Removed vehicles with out of era weapons such as Gauss and ER Lasers (to do: review all vehicles to ensure that they exist by 3025)
* Removed MON-68, 69 and 70 out of the Common pool since Dicalliper pointed out correctly that they use EndoSteel/FibroFerrous; eventually they'll be either removed or reassigned to another faction
* Fixed excessive number of Cicadas appearing - fix will be permanent once all the 'Mech tags are reviewed (WIP)
* Typos and editing fixes for several 'Mech and systems descriptions (ongoing process)
* Added Machine Gun Ammo (half) to stores

* Added more variants to the vanilla Heavy 'Mechs - Quickdraw, Dragon, Thunderbolt, Catapult, Grasshopper and Orion
* Added 8 new star systems from the Aurigan sourcebook - Amnesty, Contrilla, Eliat, Fairuza, Highwater, Nuncavoy, Polybius and Taygete
