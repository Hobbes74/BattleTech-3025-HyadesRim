        "Details": "Althea's Choice was named after the captain of a JumpShip who suffered a misjump while in route to their final destination.  Rather than wait for outside help that might never have arrived, the expedition leader decided to colonize the planet where they had become stranded.  While the world was considered a wasteland with harsh conditions, the later discovery of metal deposits has improved its economy.",
