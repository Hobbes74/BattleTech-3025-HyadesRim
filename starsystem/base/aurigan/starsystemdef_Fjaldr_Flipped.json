        "Details": "The original colony was largely underground, built in the sides of deep kilometer-wide shafts that breach the ice that envelops this world. Fjaldr survives on its rich mineral resources and its position as a well-connected hub world near the Inner Sphere. Later settlements were bombarded by Taurian warships, causing the world to become abandoned.",
