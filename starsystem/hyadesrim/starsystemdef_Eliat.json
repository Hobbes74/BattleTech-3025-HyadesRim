        "Details": "Eliat disappeared from the navigational records until a disappeared DropShip was rediscovered during the last century. Unable to return to civilization because their JumpShip lost their recharging sail, the survivors were able to send an emergency transmission.  Unfortunately, when the signal was finally received decades later, the crew was long dead when the rescue party arrived, although only a few lived long lives.",
