        "Details": "This colony was eliminated in what become known as the Hawktor massacre.  After local resistance was encountered by a marauding party, a brutal attack followed on the settlements at the cost of thousands of civilian lifes, with most of the population being enslaved by the pirates before returning to their haven. Survivors are known to avoid contact with any offworlders by hiding amongst the many islands.",
