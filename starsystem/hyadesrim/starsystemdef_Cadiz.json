        "Details": "Cadiz has a very diversified ecosystem which made it a prime candidate for colonization efforts. Unfortunately, the planetary biosphere has also proven itself to be remarkably resilient against attempts to planet Earth-based species to increase productivity, which has limited its development, together with several highly pathogenic native bacteria strains responsible for several deaths amongst the original colonists.",
