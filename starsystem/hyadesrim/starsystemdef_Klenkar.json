        "Details": "Klenkar was used in secret by the Taurians to train the forces used for the Periphery uprising. Later it was used as a refugee world by the Concordat during the Succession Wars, until it was abandoned after it became devastated by hunger riots and escalating violence. A truce exists between several of the remaining cities, but the rest of the planet has reverted to a state of endless war, with raids and counter-raids periodically launched between all factions.",
