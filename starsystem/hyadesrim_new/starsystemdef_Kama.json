        "Details": "Kama was for centuries a navigational waypoint until it was settled by New Hedon refugees from Dumassas. Starting in the 29th century throughout the Inner Sphere, the New Hedons chose to enjoy life as much as possible amongst the death, war, famine and disease of the Inner Sphere, and founding colonies in the Periphery. Unable to follow their eccentric pleasure rituals in Dumassas because of local hostility, they occupied one of the barely inhabitable worlds and establish a new colony, with an entertainment center that is unrivalled in the Rim.",
