        "Details": "The Twins are a double star system of two nearly identical blue giants orbited by a single planet, and it is littered with asteroid belts, restricting travel into the system. When re-discovered by Interstellar Expeditions, the system was found to contain a deactivated Star League research observatory in one of its moons still inhabited by the descendants of the original scientists and support personnel.",
