        "Details": "One of the eight original Taurian colonies located in the Hyades Cluster, Ina was mostly abandoned over the centuries as its original population left for more hospitable worlds around the Rim. The original settlement has been preserved by the Taurians as a museum, although few tourists ever arrive and the remaining population is mostly scattered around the world, with no other cities.",
