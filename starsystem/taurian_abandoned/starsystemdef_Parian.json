        "Details": "Once a thriving colony, Parian's surface was devastated after one large asteroid split off from one of the system's debris fields and impacted upon the planet, triggering several volcanoes. Despite the extreme change in conditions, the Taurians were able to stop the population loss, although the world is currently too poor for further economic development.",
