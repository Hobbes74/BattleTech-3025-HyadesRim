        "Details": "An early colony within the Taurian Concordat, Menion was considered one of the 'Gateway' systems into the Haydes Cluster and was a primary assault target during the Reunification Wars as the SLDF forcibly pacified the region after it was occupied by local insurgents.  The system never recovered from the damage inflicted by the conflict and today it is little more than a lifeless rock, covered in ruins.",
