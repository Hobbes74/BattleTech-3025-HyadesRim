        "Details": "A world locked in an eternal glaciation due to the limited heat emited by its star, Amber's lack of significant natural resources has left it in a near pristine state.  Although the world belongs to the Concordat, most of its inhabitants prefer to live isolated among the frozen wastes, only appearing occasionally to trade in the few occupied settlements.",
