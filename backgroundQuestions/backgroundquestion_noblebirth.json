Until one day, invaders came to your system and as their [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDropShip],DropShip]] was visible in the skies, you saw your opportunity.\r\n\r\nSlipping undetected to the Mech Bay holding the single [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBattleMech],BattleMech]] that was used by your ruler to oppress the planet, you were able to use your technical skills to bypass the safeties of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAncestralPhoenixHawk],Phoenix Hawk]] and used it to defeat the defenders' conventional forces.\r\n\r\nThis is where you met [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMastiff],Raju \"Mastiff\" Montgomery]], the commander of the lance sent to your world, who became impressed by your new found skills as a [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMechWarrior],MechWarrior]] and offered you and your new <i>Phoenix Hawk</i> a trainee slot on his unit."
