Slavish adherence to a formal ritual is a sign that one has nothing better to think about. - Natasha Kerensky, Blood Legacy.

Features
* A new BattleTech story and Campaign mode, consisting of original story missions and flashpoints, based on an alternative history of the Arano Restoration where Kamea is exiled rather than presumed killed and the company enters the employ of Interstellar Expeditions;
* Thirteen original story missions and flashpoints released (campaign only): You On The Run, Exodus, The Periphery Is A Harsh Mistress, The Mad Cat Who Walks Through Walls, Here Might Be Dragons, Jinxed, It Came From The Rim, Death's Mask, God Mecha, Amaris Legacy, Tales of 1001 BattleMechs, The Man Comes Around and Danse Macabre. More are planned for parts 3 and 4 of the new campaign;
* The vanilla FPs are now be played in the new story as mini-campaigns, except for the Black Widow one;
* Several new events that include crew deaths, a parrot, JumpShip issues, and assorted oddities;
* 312 new playable star systems, adding all of the Taurian, Canopian and Marian worlds plus several Deep Periphery systems, with the star map extended in all directions to also include more Davion, Liao and Marik systems;
* 40+ original subfactions, canon and new, with their own contracts and 'Mech variants. Ally/fight pirate gangs, corporations, regional powers and bandit kingdoms;
* 600+ new contracts and variants added, several rewritten from the vanilla ones with a Periphery flavor;
* 350+ new BattleMech variants added to fight as Opfor, can appear equipped with Infernos, ECM, plus other LosTech surprises;
* All the 'Mech quirks of the Heavy Metal DLC can now appear on any 'Mech model (only certain factions will use them)
* 22 new vehicle variants, called 'technicals', only used by pirate factions;
* 77 canon variants of the vanilla 'Mechs, nearly all of the 3025 era and SLDF variants;
* Setting and tech follow the 3025 starting date;
* Career mode has nearly everything from above available, except for the story missions/flashpoints;
* Stores/Black Markets have been changed to restore the appearance of LosTech to before the HM DLC was released;
* Tonnage restrictions - all procedural contracts, original and new, may now appear with maximum tonnage restrictions for the player. 
* Contract Difficulty - All the contracts may now appear in all system difficulty levels;
* Otherwise, keeps everything else unchanged from the vanilla game.

Disclaimer
* The objective of this mod is not a total overhaul of the base game, but the opposite: to keep it as unchanged as possible while expanding it with new and original material; 
* The game aspects that have been changed were done for two reasons: revert the game to the beginning of the 3025 era (pre-HM DLC) and for storytelling proposes;
* This is Work In Progress - expect bugs (and please report them here, or the Hyades Rim Discord - link above)

Requirements﻿
* ModTek 0.8.0.0 - https://github.com/BattletechModders/ModTek
* All DLCs (Flashpoint, Urban Warfare and Heavy Metal)
* No other mods are required

Installation
* Unzip the folder to the /Mods folder created as part of ModTek's installation guidelines.

Known Issues (none are gamebreaking just inconveniences):
* When playing FPs on the Leopard, there's a glitch after conversations with the bridge;
* On the Amaris Legacy FP, one of the events gives an 'ERROR' on the text;
* A saved star map won't update when new mod versions are released that change it;

Recommended Mods
* Navigation Computer by mpstark - makes travel easier
* BattleTechPerformanceFix by m22spencer - reduces the time to generate new contracts

Warning: Use any other mods at your own risk - I only use these two mods together with the Hyades Rim and I do not provide support for third party mod integration! Check the other-mods channel of the Discord server for more information on other mods.
