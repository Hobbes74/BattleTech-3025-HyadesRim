Features
* A new BattleTech story and Campaign mode, consisting of 28 planned new flashpoints, based on the unofficial history of the Arano Restoration where Kamea Arano wasn't presumed killed as the ComStar cover-up claims (a.k.a. original campaign). Instead, she was exiled and the company entered the service of canon BattleTech figures such as Interstellar Expeditions and Chandrasekhar Kurita and the real events of the Aurigan campaign were suppressed. 
* Sixteen original story missions and flashpoints released (campaign only): You On The Run, Exodus, Evil Eye, The Periphery Is A Harsh Mistress, The Mad Cat Who Walks Through Walls, Here Might Be Dragons, Jinxed, It Came From The Rim, Death's Mask, God Mecha, Amaris Legacy, Tales of 1001 BattleMechs, The Man Comes Around, Danse Macabre, Putting Out A Fire, Backdoor Man and Dark Forest. 12 more are planned for parts 3 and 4 of the new campaign.
* New story includes so far a total of 87 new contracts, 116 new crew conversations and 186 descriptions, and is divided into four parts.
* The vanilla FPs appear in the new Campaign as independent mini-campaigns, except for the Black Widow one which is removed (but still appears on Career mode).
* 473 new playable star systems, adding all of the Taurian, Canopian and Marian worlds plus several Deep Periphery systems, with the star map extended in all directions to also include more Davion, Liao and Marik systems. All of the new systems' descriptions have been written to reflect the 3025 BattleTech era.
* 88 new events that include crew deaths, a parrot, JumpShip issues, and assorted oddities, all part of living during a difficult period and region of space, with wars flaring up all the national sentiments.
* 52+ original factions, canon and new, with their own leaders, allies/enemies, contracts and 'Mech/vehicle variants. Ally/fight pirate gangs, corporations, regional powers and bandit kingdoms in both campaign and system contracts.
* 600+ new contracts and variants added, including pirate, IE and Periphery flavored.
* 700+ new BattleMech variants added to fight as Opfor, can appear equipped with Infernos, ECM, plus other LosTech surprises.
* Tonnage restrictions - all procedural contracts, original and new, may now appear with maximum tonnage restrictions for the player; each system's contracts should be roughly divided 50%-50% between no restrictions and restrictions. Tonnage restrictions are 160t for 0-3 difficulty contracts, 210t for 4-6 and 260t for 7-10.
* All the 'Mech quirks of the Heavy Metal DLC can now appear on any 'Mech model (only certain factions will use them).
* 23 new vehicle variants, called 'technicals', only used by pirate factions.
* 77 canon variants of the vanilla 'Mechs, nearly all of the 3025 era and SLDF variants.
* 24 new turrets, several equipped with artillery pieces.
* 33 new BattleMech upgrades, all based on the 'Mech quirks of the Heavy Metal DLC.
* Opfor pilots levels can vary, being possible to encounter pilots with a different skill levels than the contract's difficulty.
* Pilot backgrounds now also include Kurita Noble, Steiner Noble, Marian, Circinus, Lothian, Illyrian and Deep Periphery.
* More terrain variety - in the original game each contract (like One Man's Art) can only appear at a certain system difficulty. Those limitations have been removed, allowing for a greater terrain variety during contracts. 
* Career mode has nearly everything from above available, except for the story missions/flashpoints.

Balance and Story Changes
* During the campaign you'll lose several pilots as a result of non-combat events. This high crew turnover is done for both storytelling and balance proposes, since you start as a third rate mercenary company operating at the end of civilized space.
* For most of the campaign you'll use the Hysteria (Leopard), and only get the Argo at the end of part 3, with the Golden Path flashpoint. 
* The new campaign flashpoints all have tonnage limits and many have consecutive deployments. This is done to increase the challenge of having to run multiple operations with limited assets, and for story telling proposes, since the story of the flashpoint involves fast operations. Many also have choices that can mitigate the number of consecutive deployments or allow you to use third-party 'Mechs.
* The original flashpoints of the five Inner Sphere factions are now played sequentially, starting with the lowest difficulty FP. They've been also integrated in the storyline as related to the start of the 4th Succession War.
* On campaign, JumpShip access to the Inner Sphere is limited, and depends on you unlocking letters of marque from the Successor Lords (which also unlock their faction FPs).
* The special equipment of the Marauder has been nerfed, with the Called Shot ability reduced from a 33% maximum to 25%, and the 10% damage reduction only applying to the Marauder, not the whole lance.
* Stores/Black Markets have been changed to restore the appearance of LosTech to before the HM DLC was released.

Disclaimer
* The objective of this mod is not a total overhaul of the base game, but the opposite: to keep it as unchanged as possible while expanding it with new and original material.
* This is Work In Progress - expect bugs (and please report them on the Hyades Rim Discord - link above).

Requirements﻿
* ModTek 0.8.0.0 - https://github.com/BattletechModders/ModTek
* All DLCs (Flashpoint, Urban Warfare and Heavy Metal)
* No other mods are required

Installation
* Unzip the folder to the /Mods folder created as part of ModTek's installation guidelines.

Known Issues (none are gamebreaking just inconveniences):
* When playing FPs on the Leopard, there's a visual glitch after any conversations with the DropShip's bridge and other areas. This can be solved by saving and reloading the game.
* On the Amaris Legacy FP, one of the events displays a yellow 'ERROR' message in the middle of the text.
* A saved star map won't update when new mod versions are released that change it, so system tags and black market markers might become inaccurate with future mod updates.

Recommended Mods
* Navigation Computer by mpstark - makes travel easier
* BattleTechPerformanceFix by m22spencer - reduces the time to generate new contracts

Warning: Use any other mods at your own risk - I only use these two mods together with the Hyades Rim and I do not provide support for third party mod integration! Check the other-mods channel of the Discord server for more information on compatibility with other mods.

Future Plans
* Finish the new Campaign with new contracts, missions and flashpoints - release date Winter 2021.
