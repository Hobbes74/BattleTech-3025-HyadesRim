BattleTech 3025 Hyades Rim

BattleTech 1.9.X compatible - requires all DLCs. Work in progress.

Slavish adherence to a formal ritual is a sign that one has nothing better to think about. - Natasha Kerensky, Blood Legacy.

It is 3024 and Lady Kamea Arano has been exiled after being rescued by the survivors of Markham's Marauders during House Espinosa's coup. Her remaining forces have joined with the company in search for mercenary work in the Deep Periphery. But as the 4th Succession War approaches, powerful forces are now threatening to destroy the entire Aurigan Reach unless Kamea can save her realm and reclaim her throne. Work in progress.

Features
* A new BattleTech story and Campaign mode, consisting of 40 planned new flashpoints, based on the unofficial history of the Arano Restoration where Kamea Arano wasn't presumed killed as the ComStar cover-up claims (a.k.a. original campaign). Instead, she was exiled and the company entered the service of canon BattleTech figures such as Interstellar Expeditions and Chandrasekhar Kurita and the real events of the Aurigan campaign were suppressed.
* Thirty original flashpoints released, campaign mode only: You On The Run, Exodus, Evil Eye, The Periphery Is A Harsh Mistress, The Mad Cat Who Walks Through Walls, Here Might Be Dragons, Jinxed, It Came From The Rim, Death's Mask, God Mecha, Amaris Legacy, Tales of 1001 BattleMechs, The Man Comes Around, Danse Macabre, Putting Out A Fire, A Country Too Far, Paradise City, Kiss Them For Me, Bandit Kingdoms and Petty Tyrants, The Magistrate,  Flesh For Fantasy, Heads Will Roll, Backdoor Man, Dark Forest, Horse Latitudes, Stranger In A Strange Land, Dark Horse, Comanche Moon, Question Of Faith and Speak Of The Devil.
* Ten more campaign flashpoints are being written for parts 2 and 3 of the new campaign: Otaku, Wilderness, Dreams of Nagayan Valley, Vortex, Arano Restoration, Ghost Riders In The Sky, Unnatural Selection, Barbarians At The Gates, Atomic and The Eyes Of Truth.
* New story includes a total of 114 new contracts rewritten from the originals, 145 original crew conversations and 295 additional lore descriptions, and is divided into three parts, each with its own subarcs.
* The vanilla FPs are included in the new Campaign as independent mini-campaigns, except for the Black Widow mini-campaign but still appears on Career mode.
* 473 new playable star systems, adding all of the Taurian, Canopian and Marian worlds plus several Deep Periphery systems, with the star map extended in all directions to also include more Davion, Liao and Marik systems, as well as other Periphery realms. All of the new systems' descriptions have been written to reflect the 3025 BattleTech era.
* 87 new events that include crew deaths, a parrot, JumpShip issues, and assorted oddities, all part of living during a difficult period and region of space, with wars flaring up all the national sentiments.
* 55+ original factions, canon and new, with their own leaders, allies/enemies, contracts and 'Mech/vehicle variants. Ally/fight pirate gangs, corporations, regional powers and bandit kingdoms in both campaign and system contracts.
* 66 new cast characters, several with new artwork.
* 600+ new contracts and variants added, including pirate, IE and Periphery flavored.
* 700+ new BattleMech variants added to fight as Opfor, can appear equipped with Infernos, ECM, plus other LosTech surprises.
* Optional - Community Asset Bundle integration, currently adding the Charger, Clint, Crusader, Dervish, Falcon, Firebee, Firefly, Marauder II, Mongoose, Ostroc, Ostsol, Ostwar, Stinger, Talos, Thug, Toro, Valkyrie, Wasp and Wolfhound 'Mech models.
* All the 'Mech quirks of the Heavy Metal DLC can now appear on any 'Mech model (only certain factions will use them).
* 23 new vehicle variants, called 'technicals', only used by pirate factions.
* 77 canon variants of the vanilla 'Mechs, nearly all of the 3025 era and SLDF variants.
* 24 new turrets, several equipped with artillery pieces.
* 33 new BattleMech upgrades, all based on the 'Mech quirks of the Heavy Metal DLC.
* Pilot backgrounds now also include Kurita Noble, Steiner Noble, Marian, Circinus, Lothian, Illyrian and Deep Periphery.
* Career mode has nearly everything from above available, except for the story missions/flashpoints.

Balance and Story Changes
* For most of the campaign you'll use the Hysteria (Leopard), and only get the Argo at the end of part 2, with the Question Of Faith campaign flashpoint.
* All of the original campaign contracts have been modified and the text rewritten according to the new story.
* Several of the new campaign flashpoints have consecutive deployments. This is done to increase the challenge of having to run multiple operations with limited assets, and for story telling proposes, since the story of the flashpoint involves fast operations. Certain flashpoint choices can reduce the number of consecutive deployments or allow you to use third-party 'Mechs.
* The original flashpoints of the five Inner Sphere factions are optional to play during the campaign, and will immediately precede the 4th Succession War. They're also played sequentially, starting from the lowest difficulty.
* On campaign, JumpShip access to the Inner Sphere is limited, and depends on you unlocking letters of marque from the Successor Lords (which also unlock their faction FPs).
* More terrain variety - in the original game each contract (like One Man's Art) can only appear at a certain system difficulty and certain campaign milestones. Those limitations have been removed, allowing for a greater terrain variety during contracts. 
* The special equipment of the Marauder has been nerfed, with the Called Shot ability reduced from a 33% maximum to 25%, and the 10% damage reduction only applying to the Marauder, not the whole lance.
* Stores/Black Markets have been changed to restore the appearance of LosTech to before the HM DLC was released.
* Opfor pilots levels can vary, being possible to encounter pilots with a different skill levels than the contract's difficulty; there's also a chance some of them will be immune to headshots (to balance the Called Shot ability).

Disclaimer
* The objective of this mod is not a total overhaul of the base game, but the opposite: to keep it as unchanged as possible while expanding it with new and original material, based on the canon BattleTech universe.
* This is Work In Progress - expect bugs (and please report them on the Hyades Rim Discord - link above).
* The story and its characters are a mixture of both BattleTech canon and fan fiction and the writing contains vulgar language, personal insults, fictional slurs, drug/alcohol consumption, sexual references, lack of morals and physical violence. If you're legally underage and/or offended by any of these, do not play any of the BattleTech games or this mod.

Known Issues
* When playing FPs on the Leopard, there's a visual glitch (a.k.a. 'löyly') after any conversations with the DropShip's bridge and other areas. This has no effect on gameplay can be solved by saving and reloading the game.
* A saved star map won't update when new mod versions are released that change it, so system tags and black market markers might become inaccurate with future mod updates. 
* Occasionally the campaign might freeze if you've just completed a story mission (non-FP) right before getting the end of the month report. This appears to be a Unity bug, for safety always end the month if you're on its last day before starting the flashpoint.
* BattleTechPerformanceFix has a known bug that sometimes prevents a mission to be completed - it can be overriden by enabling debug mode and using it to end the contract;
